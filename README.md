** This is a work in progress and not yet released **

ALVR² is a Virtual Reality streaming application.<br>
Designed to play VR games from a standalone headset.<br>
With a focus on low-latency, compatibily and simplicity.<br>

This project is based on the original ALVR project from [polygraphene](https://github.com/polygraphene)
and the ALVR fork from [JackD83](https://github.com/JackD83) and [zarik5](https://github.com/zarik5).

Note: This is the streaming application, you'll need an ALVR client on your headset.
